# Web-Scraping-Scripts

This repo is a place for some of the web scraping scripts and notes I've compiled on scraping with python.  
The majority of these scripts are from Automate the Boring Stuff by Al Sweigart and some from pythonprogramming.net 
I used these scripts/notes to learn about python and web programming over the years, and often find myself referring to them.
